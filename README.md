# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## Project Description
This project involves the collection and cleaning of a dataset to create a tidy data set that can be used for further analysis. The data was collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by participants performing various activities.

## Files in the Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: An R script that performs the analysis and produces the tidy dataset.
- `README.md`: This file, which explains the project and how to run the script.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book that describes the variables and data transformations.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place the original dataset files in the same directory as `run_analysis.R`.
3. Open R and set the working directory to the location of the repository.
4. Run the script using `source("run_analysis.R")`.

## Output
The script produces a tidy dataset that includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Acknowledgements
This dataset was created by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto. More details can be found in the dataset's original README file.
